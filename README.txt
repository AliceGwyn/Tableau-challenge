In this challenge, I used data from January of 2020, 2022, and 2024 in Jersey City to visualize the changes in ride volume and membership status over time. I started by cleaning my data as seen in the CleaningCitiBike Jupyter Notebook, then imported the data into Tableau to create visualizations. You can view the story at the link above. The first page shows a map of all Jersey City CitiBike rides in January of each year, with the station markers changing size and color based on year and volume of rides. Clicking on any section of the pie chart will highlight only the rides from that year. The second page displays a stacked bar chart with the most popular stations. Again, clicking on the pie chart will allow you to see each year individually. The third page shows how membership has changed over the years, with a decrease from 2020-2022 and a large increase from 2022-2024. Clicking on any section of the line graph will show only those points of interest on the associated map.
