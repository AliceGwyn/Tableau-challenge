Two unexpected phenomena: 
1. One of the most popular stations in 2020 and 2022 was closed by 2024 as new stations popped up around it.
	This shows that as the program becomes more popular and is able to expand, the placement of stations is becoming more ideal. The popularity of this station may have contributed to the decision to install new stations in the same area, and these new stations were apparently better placed that the original station, as they continued to be used, and the original station was shut down, likely due to decreased usage.

2. There was a marked decrease in member rides between 2020 and 2022, even with a significant increase in casual rides.
	The decrease between 2020 and 2022 in member rides was likely due to a decline in people commuting to in-office work during the pandemic. However, this number increased significantly between 2022 an 2024, indicating that the program is still strong and has more than recovered from the decrease due to Covid-19. In the same time period as the member ride decrease, there was also a huge uptick in casual rides, possibly indicating better marketing of casual ride options during this time, or the increase in outdoor activities during this time period. Casual rides continued to increase, albeit more slowly, after 2022, showing that the overall popularity of the program is increasing. Marketing and new stations opening up are likely contributing to the increasing popularity.
